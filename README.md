Why?
- No longer the Mobile layout/view but the rise of Responsive Design
- Bootstrap integration into Joomla 3.x 
- LESS development 
- Support Megamenu, Offcanvas, and Sticky menu
- ThemeMagic ( lets you customize themes without having to search for the right file or without diving into the code )

These things have opened a whole new way of how a Joomla template should be developed.
